# mi349fs15: Web design and development

These are the finished assignments for a class for Web Design and Development.  The end result is located at http://tuscan-chicken-wrap.github.io/
The class discussed aspects of web design, coding, and deployment; we progressed from writing out our short/long pitches to wireframes, and finally, the website.
It was a very enjoyable class, and I've been able to use the knowledge in other projects as well.
